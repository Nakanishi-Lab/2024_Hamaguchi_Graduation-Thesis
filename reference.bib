ABSTRACT = {Bionic amphibious robots are the intersection of biology and robotics; they have the advantages of environmental adaptability and maneuverability. An amphibious robot that combines walking and swimming move modes inspired by a crab (Portunus) is presented in this article. The outstanding characteristic of the robot is that its environmental adaptability relies on the bionic multi-modal movement, which is based on two modular bionic swimming legs and six modular walking legs. We designed the biomimetic crab robot based on the biological observation results. The design, analysis, and simulation of its structure and motion parameters are introduced in this paper. The swimming propulsion capability and the walking performance are verified through indoor, pool, and seaside experiments. In conclusion, the designed bionic crab robot provides a platform with practical application capabilities in amphibious environment detection, concealed reconnaissance, and aquaculture.},

abstract = {Decapod crustaceans have been the focus of neuroethological studies for decades. With few exceptions, however, their musculature remains scarcely described. We study the neuroethology of legged locomotion in the portly spider crab, Libinia emarginata (Brachyura, Majoidea), which preferentially walks forward. Majoid crabs are thought to be among the first to have adopted the crab form (carcinification) from lobster-like ancestors, making them interesting subjects for comparative and phylogenetic studies. The radial arrangement of the legs around the thorax, coupled with its unidirectional walking modality makes L. emarginata a good candidate for the presence of anterior and posterior limb specializations. Here we describe the complete muscular anatomy of all the pereopods of L. emarginata and compare our findings with other decapods described in the literature. The number of proximal muscle bundles differs between the anterior and posterior pereopods of L. emarginata. We describe an intersegmental bundle of the flexor muscle similar to the one present in distantly related, forward walking macruran species. The behavioral repertoire, amenability to experimental investigations, and phylogenetic position make spider crabs useful species for the study of the neural control of legged locomotion. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of a complete description and comparison of the musculature in all the locomotor appendages of one species.}

abstract = {Most brachyuran crabs use their pereiopods as walking legs, but there are also a number of species, in which the last (5th) pair of pereiopods (P5) are specialized to permit a unique mode of swimming. One of these P5-swimming crabs is Liocarcinus depurator, commonly found on European shores. We present 3-dimensional μCT-based reconstructions of the axial skeletons and 5th pereiopods (P5), including the intrinsic and extrinsic musculature of the P5, of L. depurator and of two other non-swimming brachyuran crabs, Cancer pagurus and Carcinus maenas. In Liocarcinus, we also present a reconstruction of the 4th pereiopod (P4) together with its intrinsic musculature. We further use 3-dimensional prints of the reconstructed P5 coxa and basi-ischium of L. depurator as well as thoracal parts near the thoracal−coxal arthrodial cavity to build a model which can simulate the effects of muscular activity based on muscle insertions in our 3D reconstruction and under various simulated tensile vectors. This enables us to test muscular functions that had previously been speculated upon. Reconstructed morphological structures are compared to find differences that may explain why of the three species, only L. depurator is able to swim. Significant differences between Liocarcinus and the non-swimmers Cancer and Carcinus were found in the shape of the axial skeleton, external P5 morphology and the dimensions and origin sites of the extrinsic P5 musculature, but not in the intrinsic musculature of the P5. Inclination angle measurements of P1 thoracal−coxal articulation axes against P5 axes showed that in Cancer and Carcinus, angles in the longitudinal plane were smaller than in the lateral one, whereas in Liocarcinus, they were greater. Inclination angles in the longitudinal plane were also much greater in Liocarcinus than in Cancer and Carcinus. 3D print muscular activity simulation showed that muscles inserting at the basi-ischium, which are often referred to as “levator” or “depressor” muscles, may actually also function as promotors or remotors, depending on the tensile vector within which the muscle is acting.}
